            <p>Hello! My name is Ahmad Ali and I'm originally from Karachi, Pakistan.  My family and I came to the United States in '98 when I was only two years old. Before finding myself at Code Fellows, I was a personal trainer at 24 Hour Fitness, whilst also pursuing a degree in Business Management. I hope the path I am on now will prove to be useful and be of benefit to myself and the community around me.</p>
